Computer-Made Pets

Main goal of this project is to get rid of all the barriers that come our ways when we decide to get a pet. Those might be: flat restrictions, alergies, parent issues, etc.. 

With the help of this project, you will be able to have a pet friend of your own choice.


Step-by-step Pet Tutorial:

    1. Specify the name, age, current-hunger and current-fitness of your pet.

    2. Talk to your pet if they need a walk or food.

    3. Feed or walk your pet as desired.

    3. Increment their age accordingly but be careful they do not live long :(
    
    4. Dont forget to love your pet!!!
